# VibeJam Governance

## Purpose
VibeJam optimizes for credible progress signals, durable identity, and honest public accountability. We choose clarity over growth and signal over spectacle.

## What We Avoid
- Launch day hype
- Trending races
- Vanity metrics
- Fake urgency
- Growth promises or exposure guarantees

## Change Types
- Cosmetic: reversible styling changes with no behavioral impact.
- Behavioral: changes that alter flow, defaults, or user behavior.
- Narrative: changes that alter meaning, identity, or product stance.
- Trust-affecting: changes that alter credibility signals, proof, or public legibility.

## Review Discipline
- Behavioral: requires review and explicit intent.
- Narrative: rare, high impact. Requires team approval.
- Trust-affecting: must be observable, reversible, and explicitly approved.

## Launch Cadence
- Observe-only window: 30 days after launch.
- Log insights, do not ship fixes.
- One intentional iteration per cycle after the window ends.

## Evaluation Questions
- Does this make progress more legible without creating pressure?
- Does this reduce or increase trust?
- Is the change reversible without a rollback?
- Does this drift toward hype, rankings, or vanity?

## Defaults
- No new features by default.
- Changes must be intentional, observable, and reversible.
